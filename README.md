Blockchain voting refers to a voting system where the vote casting and counting processes are secured using blockchain technology. This creates a transparent, secure, and tamper-proof record of the votes cast, reducing the possibility of fraud and increasing trust in the election process. Blockchain voting can also increase accessibility by enabling remote voting and reducing the cost of running elections.
The technology allows for increased transparency, security, and accuracy in the voting process, and helps prevent tampering or manipulation of the vote results. The decentralized and transparent nature of blockchain makes it difficult for anyone to tamper with the data, ensuring fair and secure elections.
